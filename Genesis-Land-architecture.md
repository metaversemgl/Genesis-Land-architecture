# Genesis-Land-architecture
Unlike to other Metaverse lands that have used the Google Maps Api in Blender software to build their land. Genesis Land is designing its own multi-layer land with Barachiel engine.
Demo version will be released on this week. In order for users to better communicate with Genesis Land, we have used AR technology so that users can use their smartphones to see the view of Genesis Land in real-time and 3D.
After the AR version, we will have a VR webinar so that we can have a demo with questions and answers from webinar participants.
To support the holders, we transfer the pieces of land only with MGLC Token.
